-Some thing that was interesting about working with our group was that all of us were
still fairly new to Java and had asked questions between each other in order to complete
parts of the project. We also mainly used Discord as a means to communicate and work together
through sharing our screens and messaging useful links to clear up confusion.

-Dominic had mostly done the coding itself, while Christian, Kevin and I both helped and provided him with
resources and tips on how best to approach different parts of the project.
